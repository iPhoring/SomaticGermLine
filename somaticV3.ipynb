       "      <td>DISEASE: Aniridia 1 (AN1) [MIM:106210]: A congenital, bilateral, panocular disorder characterized by complete absence of the iris or extreme iris hypoplasia. Aniridia is not just an isolated defect in iris development but it is associated with macular and optic nerve hypoplasia, cataract, corneal changes, nystagmus. Visual acuity is generally low but is unrelated to the degree of iris hypoplasia. Glaucoma is a secondary problem causing additional visual loss over time. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10234503, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10737978, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11309364, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11553050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11826019, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12552561, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12634864, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16493447, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17595013, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21850189, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24033328, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8364574, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9147640, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9281415, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9792406, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9856761, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9931324, ECO:0000269|Ref.27, ECO:0000269|Ref.28}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Anterior segment dysgenesis 5 (ASGD5) [MIM:604229]: A form of anterior segment dysgenesis, a group of defects affecting anterior structures of the eye including cornea, iris, lens, trabecular meshwork, and Schlemm canal. Anterior segment dysgeneses result from abnormal migration or differentiation of the neural crest derived mesenchymal cells that give rise to components of the anterior chamber during eye development. Different anterior segment anomalies may exist alone or in combination, including iris hypoplasia, enlarged or reduced corneal diameter, corneal vascularization and opacity, posterior embryotoxon, corectopia, polycoria, abnormal iridocorneal angle, ectopia lentis, and anterior synechiae between the iris and posterior corneal surface. Clinical conditions falling within the phenotypic spectrum of anterior segment dysgeneses include aniridia, Axenfeld anomaly, Reiger anomaly/syndrome, Peters anomaly, and iridogoniodysgenesis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10441571, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12721955, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8162071}.

       "125  DISEASE: Aniridia 1 (AN1) [MIM:106210]: A congenital, bilateral, panocular disorder characterized by complete absence of the iris or extreme iris hypoplasia. Aniridia is not just an isolated defect in iris development but it is associated with macular and optic nerve hypoplasia, cataract, corneal changes, nystagmus. Visual acuity is generally low but is unrelated to the degree of iris hypoplasia. Glaucoma is a secondary problem causing additional visual loss over time. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10234503, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10737978, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11309364, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11553050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11826019, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12552561, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12634864, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16493447, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17595013, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21850189, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24033328, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8364574, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9147640, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9281415, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9792406, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9856761, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9931324, ECO:0000269|Ref.27, ECO:0000269|Ref.28}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Anterior segment dysgenesis 5 (ASGD5) [MIM:604229]: A form of anterior segment dysgenesis, a group of defects affecting anterior structures of the eye including cornea, iris, lens, trabecular meshwork, and Schlemm canal. Anterior segment dysgeneses result from abnormal migration or differentiation of the neural crest derived mesenchymal cells that give rise to components of the anterior chamber during eye development. Different anterior segment anomalies may exist alone or in combination, including iris hypoplasia, enlarged or reduced corneal diameter, corneal vascularization and opacity, posterior embryotoxon, corectopia, polycoria, abnormal iridocorneal angle, ectopia lentis, and anterior synechiae between the iris and posterior corneal surface. Clinical conditions falling within the phenotypic spectrum of anterior segment dysgeneses include aniridia, Axenfeld anomaly, Reiger anomaly/syndrome, Peters anomaly, and iridogoniodysgenesis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10441571, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12721955, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8162071}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Foveal hypoplasia 1 (FVH1) [MIM:136520]: An isolated form of foveal hypoplasia, a developmental defect of the eye defined as the lack of foveal depression with continuity of all neurosensory retinal layers in the presumed foveal area. Clinical features include absence of foveal pit on optical coherence tomography, absence of foveal hyperpigmentation, absence of foveal avascularity, absence of foveal and macular reflexes, decreased visual acuity, and nystagmus. Anterior segment anomalies and cataract are observed in some FVH1 patients. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8640214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9931324}.

The clinical presentation is variable. Some individuals may present with minimal defects in the anterior iris leaf without other ocular defects. More complex malformations create a combination of iris, uveoretinal and/or optic nerve defects without or with microphthalmia or even anophthalmia. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12721955}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Coloboma of optic nerve (COLON) [MIM:120430]: An ocular defect that is due to malclosure of the fetal intraocular fissure affecting the optic nerve head. In some affected individuals, it appears as enlargement of the physiologic cup with severely affected eyes showing huge cavities at the site of the disk. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12721955}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia (BONH) [MIM:165550]: A congenital anomaly in which the optic disk appears abnormally small.

Anterior segment dysgeneses result from abnormal migration or differentiation of the neural crest derived mesenchymal cells that give rise to components of the anterior chamber during eye development. Different anterior segment anomalies may exist alone or in combination, including iris hypoplasia, enlarged or reduced corneal diameter, corneal vascularization and opacity, posterior embryotoxon, corectopia, polycoria, abnormal iridocorneal angle, ectopia lentis, and anterior synechiae between the iris and posterior corneal surface. Clinical conditions falling within the phenotypic spectrum of anterior segment dysgeneses include aniridia, Axenfeld anomaly, Reiger anomaly/syndrome, Peters anomaly, and iridogoniodysgenesis.    \n",

Osteopetrosis occurs in two forms: a severe autosomal recessive form occurring in utero, infancy, or childhood, and a benign autosomal dominant form occurring in adolescence or adulthood. OPTA1 is an autosomal dominant form characterized by generalized osteosclerosis most pronounced in the cranial vault. Patients are often asymptomatic, but some suffer from pain and hearing loss. It appears to be the only type of osteopetrosis not associated with an increased fracture rate.    \n",

VEOIBD is subdivided into Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis phenotypes. Crohn disease may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus, but the phenotype of children with onset of Crohn disease occurring younger than the age of 10 is predominantly colonic, with a lower risk of ileal disease. Bowel inflammation is transmural and discontinuous; it may contain granulomas or be associated with intestinal or perianal fistulas.

It is characterized by watery diarrhea in infants fed with breast milk or other lactose-containing formulas. An almost total lack of LCT activity is found in jejunal biopsy material of patients with congenital lactase deficiency. Opposite to congenital lactase deficiency, also known as lactose intolerance, is the most common enzyme deficiency worldwide. It is caused by developmental down-regulation of lactase activity during childhood or early adulthood. The decline of lactase activity is a normal physiological phenomenon; however, the majority of Northern Europeans have the ability to maintain lactase activity and digest lactose throughout life (lactase persistence). The down-regulation of lactase activity operates at the transcriptional level and it is associated with a noncoding variation in the MCM6 gene, located in the upstream vicinity of LCT.    \n",

Mutations have been found with high prevalence in chondroblastoma and giant cell tumors of bone, and with low frequency in osteosarcoma, conventional chondrosarcoma and clear cell chondrosarcoma. Chondroblastoma samples frequently carry a H3F3B mutation affecting residue Lys-37 (H3K36), although H3F3A is mutated in some cases. Most giant cell tumors of bone harbor H3F3A mutations affecting residue Gly-35 (H3G34).    \n",

In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH).    \n",

Affected infants show a tendency to startle, with contractions of the facial muscles in response to tactile stimuli or during crying, trismus, abundant salivation, and opisthotonus. These features are referred to as Crisponi syndrome and can result in early death in infancy. Patients who survive into childhood have hyperhidrosis, mainly of the upper body, in response to cold temperatures, and sweat very little with heat.

The mean length of the small intestine in CSBS patients is approximately 50 cm, compared with a normal length at birth of 190-280 cm. Patients with CSBS may develop severe malnutrition as a result of the hugely reduced absorptive surface of the small intestine. Infants require parenteral nutrition for survival. However, parenteral nutrition itself causes life-threatening complications such as sepsis and liver failure which are associated with a high rate of mortality early in life.    \n",
